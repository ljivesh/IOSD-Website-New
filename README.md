# IOSD Website Project

Welcome to the IOSD Website project! This project aims to develop a modern and dynamic website for the International Organization of Software Developers (IOSD). We use Vite as our build tool, TypeScript for type safety, Shadcn for styling, React for building user interfaces, and React Router for managing navigation within the application.
